                            <p2><strong>Where to start...</strong><br></p2>
                            <h8>I am a 20 year old lad from Swords, who has a strong interest in Computer Science, Music, Football and Film. 
                                Obviously I am studying Computer Science in Trinity College Dublin, I've learned so much and I have gained many unique experiences
                                but I've also been fortunate enough to meet many great people and characters whom I am lucky to call friends. <br><br>Anyways, 
                                I played semi-proffesional football for Drogheda United in the League of Ireland. I am obsessed with music and several artists such as; Flume, 
                                deadmau5, Porter Robinson and Brockhampton. Film-wise, I love Christopher Nolan and nearly all of his films, I like Tarantino also and
                                I'm a huge fan of Denis Villeneuve.<br><br>I am actively seeking an internship for the summer of 2021!

                            <p2><strong>Computer Science...</strong><br></p2>
                            <h8>So, I actually became interested in computer's and software development way way back when Minecraft was in Beta so... 2009? I think, 
                                I was trying to mod the game as a young lad without any knowledge or expertise... It didn't go well as you can imagine. 
                                Then after years of neglecting my passion, I just happened to watch the Social Network the day of the CAO deadline, 
                                safe to say it was a great decision because it lit the fire I needed to pursue my dream of making software and websites.<br><br>
                            The end goal for me is to be happy working as a software engineer. I see myself as a creative so I would also be interested in more 
                            front-end programming and design.</h8>
                            </div>
                    </div>    
                    <div class="grid-item">

                            <p2><strong>Football...</strong><br></p2>
                            <h8>So yes, football!! I've had a long career for someone my age to be honest, I started out when I was 4 for Swords Celtic back in the day.
                             From there I went on and represented North Dublin several times and eventually made it into the League of Ireland when I was 16. 
                             I loved (almost) every minute of playing at such a high level and grew as a person and as a footballer.<br><br>If you are wondering who I support...
                              I am sorry I don't actually support anyone. Dont ask why I have no idea myself.</h8>

                            <p2><strong>Music...</strong><br></p2>
                            <h8>Well... I could write a full book on my love of music but I'll try to keep it short... FLUME love him, he's amazing and is probably my favourite. 
                                I like deadmau5 alot too he'd be second and then theres others like 
                                Porter Robinson and Brockhampton who are amazing too.<br><br>I'd listen to any music and am always open to new sounds and ideas but,
                                 I probably lean more towards electronic music on a day to day basis but I don't exclusively listen to it. For instance, 
                                 I am quite a fan of Radiohead. Although, they are quite electronic so they're probably a bad example.</h8>
